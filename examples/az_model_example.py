az_model_example.py
===================

Purpose
-------
Minimal example showing how to use `solaris_pointing.fitting.az_model`
to load previously fitted models and compute the azimuth-only offsets.
It then applies the offsets to "ideal" telescope coordinates.

Requirements
------------
- The models must have been generated beforehand (see scripts/az_model_cli.py)
  and saved as Joblib files:
  * models/az_model.joblib
  * models/el_model.joblib
- All angles in this example are in **degrees**.

What this example does
----------------------
1) Loads the azimuth and elevation models from Joblib files.
2) Computes (offset_az_deg, offset_el_deg) for a given azimuth.
3) Applies the offsets to ideal (az, el) to obtain corrected coordinates.

Usage
-----
Run the example:

    python examples/az_model_example.py

Adapt the variables `ideal_az_deg` and `ideal_el_deg` as needed.
